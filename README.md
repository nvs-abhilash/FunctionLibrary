# Functions Library
## A library to learn Algorithms and Data Structures for newbies

### What is this Repository about?
  This Repository contains all the algorithms and data structures that an
  undergrad students spends time learning.

  The motive of this repository is  **NOT** to provide a copy-paste-go solution
  to anyone for their assignments.

  **BUT**

  To enable others to acquire the skills of:
  1. *How to read code*
  2. *How to code efficiently*
  3. *Learn the best practices of a programming language*
  4. *Learn how to manage big projects*
  5. *Enjoy programming. :)*

### What can you do?
  * You can clone this repository and play with the implementations.
  * Understand why this code works.
  * If you think something is inefficient implementation, make it better.

### Reality
  Apart from big talk, this repository is far from complete. And I get very less
  time to maintain this repository. Though I will continue to maintain it.
  This could be a good chance for you to contribute to this repository.

  I want to achieve these goals in short term:
  * Re organize the repository structure.
  * Add more functions in all categories.
  * Add a make file for each function, so that they can work independently.

  So if you want to contribute, it's very easy. Just see what are you being
  taught, and see if that is implemented here or not.

#### If it is implemented:
  * Is it the best implementation?
  * Is the function well documented?
  * Can it be ran independently?

#### If not implemented:
  * Implement it :) (You will learn a lot)

### Contributing Guidelines
  There were no specific guidelines when I wrote these functions.
  But now there is a need of it.

  So, here are some guidelines:

#### C/C++
  * Variable and function names should start with small letters.
  * Every folder should be named exactly the central function of that folder.
  * One of the examples of naming conventions is sortingAlgorithms/bubbleSort.
  * There should space between function name and parenthesis.
    `printf ("Hello, world");` **CORRECT**
    `printf("Hello, world");` **INCORRECT**

##### **NOTE**: Any code not following above guidelines is treated as a bug.
